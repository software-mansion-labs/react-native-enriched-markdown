Here is some text before the first equation.

$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

The **quadratic formula** above is one of the most well-known equations in mathematics.

## Inline Math Examples

The famous equation $E = mc^2$ describes mass-energy equivalence. In physics, the force is $F = ma$ and the kinetic energy is $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$.

The Pythagorean theorem states that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ for a right triangle.

When $n$ approaches infinity, the sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k}$ diverges.

## Einstein's Famous Equation

$$E = mc^2$$

This simple yet profound equation describes the relationship between *energy* and *mass*.

## Euler's Identity

$$e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$$

Often called the most beautiful equation in mathematics, it connects five fundamental constants. The key constant $e \\approx 2.718$ is the base of natural logarithms.

## Integral Calculus

$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$$

The **Gaussian integral** appears frequently in probability and statistics.

## Maxwell's Equations

$$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}$$

$$\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}$$

These equations form the foundation of classical electromagnetism.

## Summation

$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$

The **Basel problem**, solved by Euler in 1734.
